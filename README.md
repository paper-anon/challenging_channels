#  Challenging Channels
This repository contains keys, scripts and data utilized for the paper "Challenging Channels"


## CS
*challenger.py* provides four modes: legitimate symmetric (ls), legitimate asymmetric (la), covert symmetric (cs) and covert assymetric (ca)
Synthax is as follows for each mode:
### ls
python3 prover.py ls <token logging file>

### la
python3 prover.py la <token logging file>

### cs
python3 prover.py cs <covert message file> <alphabet file> <token logging file>  <# of chars at once> 

### ca
python3 challenger.py ca <covert message file> <# of chars at once> <token logging file> 
  
*data*
 contains alphabets and scripts that were used in the paper. Please note that the malicious scripts are provided in an encrypted .zip file. 
  **Do not execute these scripts**. As these have been found in the wild and are clearly malicious and **will be detected by antivirus software**. 
  The password is "Virus"
  
*public_key_challenger.pem* public key of the challenger

*private_key_prover.pem* private key of the prover
